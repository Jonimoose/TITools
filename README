TITools 0.1
-----------

 This package contains a collection of simple command-line tools for
 communicating with TI graphing calculators.  These tools are based on
 the excellent libticalcs2 library developed by the TiLP project (or
 the equivalent libcalcprotocols library.)

 To install the TITools, first be sure that you have installed
 libticalcs2 or libcalcprotocols, along with its companion libraries
 (libticables2/libcalccables, libtifiles2/libcalcfiles, and
 libticonv/libcalcconv.)  You will also need the GLib library.

 (If you've installed these libraries from binary packages (such as
 Debian, Ubuntu, or Fedora packages), be sure that you install the
 "development" (-dev or -devel) packages as well.)

 To compile and install the TITools, run (from this directory):

        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
